## How to Download and Run

### Quick Instructions

1. Download the zip file using the link above.
2. Extract the entire zip file.
3. Right-click **WinSetView.exe**, select **Properties**, check **Unblock**, and click **OK**.
4. Run **WinSetView.exe**.
5. If you skipped step 3, then, in the SmartScreen window, click **More info** and then **Run anyway**.

**Note**: If your security software blocks the download or the app does not launch or you wish to read more about SmartScreen prompts, please see: [Download Help Guide](./DownloadHelp.md)

## How to Use

Simple step by step instructions follow.

**Note**: Nothing in Windows is changed, and no settings are saved, until the **Submit** button is pressed. Feel free to experiment with the WinSetView interface and just **X** out and restart the app to get back to where you started. Display options such as **font**, **font size**, and **theme** are also saved to the INI file and are therefore also only saved when you click **Submit**. Only the WinSetView window size and position are saved automatically when you click **X** to exit the app.

**Note**: For best results, close all open applications before running WinSetView. Open applications can prevent open/save dialog views from being updated. Apps that minimize to the System Tray when "closed", such as Discord, Steam, and qBittorrent, must be fully closed (e.g. right-click the app's System Tray icon and select `Exit`).

**Note**: Clicking **Submit** will apply the registry setting changes and restart Explorer. Do not click Submit when Explorer is busy copying/moving/deleting files.

For complete details, please see the [manual](./Manual.md).

### Step 1: Select Your Interface Language (Optional)

WinSetView should open in the same language to which you have Windows set. If not, select the correct language from the drop down menu.

### Step 2: Select Your Preferred Default View

![image](https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/assets/79026235/28e14cd3-9a3e-4a01-8a33-d12ee3a2e416)


Select the default view you want applied to most (or all) folders from the drop down menu under the **Global** heading. Most users go with **Details**, but pick what *you* like as your default.

**Note**: If you choose one of the **icons** options, a number will appear next to the drop down menu indicating the icon size. You can manually type in a custom size, such as 72, which would give you icons half-way between medium and large.

### Step 3: Select Your Preferred Default Column Headings (Optional)

![image](https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/assets/79026235/b7766339-7f07-4df4-acb6-88c8c48b2466)

If you are happy with the default Details-view column headings (as shown on screen) then skip this step.

**Note**: Column headings shown in blue are only displayed in *search results* (by default). It is, therefore, recommended to keep the **Folder path** (**File location** in Windows 11) column heading.

Otherwise, click the **Columns** button to bring up the column headings selection page.

The column headings selection page allows you to select your desired column headings (and their order), group-by options, sort options, and column widths. The [manual](./Manual.md#columns) provides full details, but you can also hover over or click on elements to see how the interface works.

### Step 4: Set Views for Specific Folder Types (Optional)

![image](https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/assets/79026235/acc2f0d2-63ce-4475-b0a0-325abb7c75e1)

Please note that WinSetView allows you to set the default view for every folder type in Windows, but, by *default*, they will all get the same settings as your **Global** settings, as long as the **Inherit** box is checked.

For any folder type (e.g. **Pictures**) that you wish to have a *different* default view than your global setting, just scroll down to that particular folder type, *uncheck* the **Inherit** box, and repeat steps 2 and 3 for that folder type.

**Note**: You don't have to set the other similar folder types separately. For example, **Pictures Library** will use the same settings as **Pictures** as long as **Inherit** is checked for **Pictures Library**.

**Note**: If you *uncheck* a folder type, then that folder type will display with its Windows default view settings (i.e. the view you would get for a new user account).

### Step 5: Check and Set Your Desired Options

![image](https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/assets/79026235/75ebc931-6d65-41e2-94d3-7624773e6004)

Click The **Options** button.

![image](https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/assets/79026235/5b99d061-124d-4f10-a840-cdf55b208638)

Review the settings on that page and adjust as desired. See the [manual](./Manual.md#options-menu) for full details. Options with a shield icon require Administrative access and will automatically pop up a UAC prompt if changed.

### Step 6: Apply the Selections to Windows File Explorer

![image](https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/assets/79026235/158ae5ca-3b21-4774-9da9-7529de86f181)

Once you're happy with your selections, make those settings apply to Windows File Explorer by clicking the **Submit** button.

You can always run WinSetView again to change any settings and you can revert back to a previous state using the **Restore** button. You also have the option of setting File Explorer back to Windows defaults by checking **Reset Views to Windows Defaults** and then clicking **Submit**.

**Note**: If you use the **Reset Views to Windows Defaults** feature, be sure to check the settings under **Options**.
