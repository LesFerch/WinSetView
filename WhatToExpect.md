## What to Expect

WinSetView is designed to set your preferred folder view defaults, and many Explorer features, with one click. This makes it very effective to get Explorer, and your folder views, set up the way you like for new computers/users or get back to your preferred settings after a major update or even after you have just been messing about.

It's ideal for anyone who wants consistent views everywhere, whether that's one view for all folder types or specific views for specific folder types. To understand what WinSetView is doing, it's important to think in terms of folder TYPES. The items listed in WinSetView, such as "Pictures" represent folder types, not individual folders.

WinSetView does NOT set views for individual folders. It actually _clears_ all of your existing folder views so that they will be displayed using your preferred defaults the next time they are opened. Therefore, if you have, for example, set up a dozen folders with a dozen different views, those views will be lost after running WinSetView. Those folders will get whatever default view you have set, for their folder type, the next time they are opened.

WinSetView is NOT designed for tweaking an individual setting. The settings in the **Folder View Options** page are always applied, along with your selected folder view defaults, when **Clear folder views and set new defaults** is checked in the **Submit** dialog. However, the settings in the **Explorer Options** page are _optional_. That is, they are only applied when **Reset Explorer options** is checked in the **Submit** dialog. The **Folder View Options** and **Explorer Options** pages include a button that will detect your current system settings. Otherwise, it shows the settings that _will be_ applied when you click **Submit**.
