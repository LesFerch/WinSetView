## What to Expect

WinSetView is designed to set your preferred folder view defaults, and many Explorer features, with one click. This makes it very effective to get Explorer, and your folder views, set up the way you like for new computers/users or get back to your preferred settings after a major update or even after you have just been messing about.

It's ideal for anyone who wants consistent views everywhere, whether that's one view for all folder types or specific views for specific folder types.

WinSetView is NOT designed for tweaking an individual setting. Please note that WinSetView does NOT set views for individual folders. It actually _deletes_ all of your existing folder views so that they will be displayed using your preferred defaults the next time they are opened. Therefore, if you have, for example, set up a dozen folders with a dozen different views, those views will be lost after running WinSetView. Those folders will get whatever default view you have set, for their folder type, the next time they are opened.

The various settings in the Options page are always applied, so you must ensure that those settings are the way you want things. WinSetView does not detect your existing settings. It's designed around the idea of applying your preferences wherever you take the tool. This pays dividends everytime you set up a new computer/user or want to get back to your preferred settings due to changes made by a major update, another user, or your own experimenting.

In a future revision of WinSetView, the options, that are not directly connected with folder views, may be made optional, but for now, they are applied, so you must set them to what you want.

If you only want to tweak a particular Explorer setting, you may want to consider other tools, such as Winaero Tweaker, but note that no other tool deals with folder view defaults, such as disabling grouping everywhere.
